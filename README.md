# 42 Cursus Cub3D

Extract from the Project Subject :

" This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way. "

### Overview
As stated above, the project goal is quite simple. The mandatory part of the project only require to be able to navigate through a level generated using ray-casting.
I personnally wanted to go further by adding ennemies, weapon, HUD, a shader to make the project more like a fully featured game.

This project is written in C and uses the minilibX, a graphic library derivated from OpenGL.
This game is designed to run on MacOS.
If you want to test it, run the Makefile and provide map.cub as an argument to the cub3D executable.
